/*
 * Task
 * 
 * Your task is to write a function which returns the n-th term of the following
 * series, which is the sum of the first n terms of the sequence (n is the input
 * parameter).
 * 
 * Series: 1 + 1/4 + 1/7 + 1/10 + 1/13 + 1/16 + …
 * 
 * You will need to figure out the rule of the series to complete this.
 * 
 * Rules
 * 
 * - You need to round the answer to 2 decimal places and return it as String.
 * - If the given value is 0 then it should return "0.00".
 * - You will only be given Natural Numbers as arguments.
 * 
 * Examples (Input --> Output)
 * 
 * n
 * 1 --> 1 --> "1.00"
 * 2 --> 1 + 1/4 --> "1.25"
 * 5 --> 1 + 1/4 + 1/7 + 1/10 + 1/13 --> "1.57"
