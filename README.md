# Codewars-Challenges
 
This repository contains the files with the challenges I completed on [Codewars](https://www.codewars.com/).
Each solved challenge is inside a file with its description as comment.

Check my Codewars profile [here](https://www.codewars.com/users/AdrianoFelix019).

## What is a Kata?
**Kata** are code challenges focused on improving skill and technique. Some train programming fundamentals, while others focus on complex problem solving. Others are puzzles meant to test your creative problem solving, while others are based on real world coding scenarios.

## What is Kyu
The terms are borrowed from a system in Japanese martial arts, which is in turn borrowed from the game of Go. *Kyu* indicates the number of degrees away from master level (Dan). This is why they count downward.

Thus, the lower the *kyu* of a **kata**, the more difficult the **kata** is, starting from 8 to 1.
